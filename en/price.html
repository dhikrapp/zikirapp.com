We started with the intention to make the best dhikr app possible and help make people do more dhikrs. 

We released our first version nearly one year ago around February time. 

In 1 year we reached 250M dhikrs (Mashallah), 2000 5 star reviews (Mashallah). Thanks to everyone. Mashallah to everyone. 

Our next goal is to achieve 1 billion dhikrs. 

In the next two years, we have many ideas, and we want to add many more features. (Inshallah)

These are 
- new types of dhikrs (Like dhikr in every 100), or serial dhikrs like 33-33-33
- dhikr groups, 
- sharing a group of dhikrs, 
- no more manual type - search from Quran or pray libraries 
- live dhikrs ( many people will do the same dhikr) 
- social dhikr requests to help you to reach your dhikr goals
- list of dhikrs for needs
- smart notifications based on your time spent, location
- motive you to do more dhikrs
- dhikrs leaderboards
- dhikrs that will be flashed to your eyes so that you can see many dhikrs in a second.
- dhikrs with head movement (Yes, we will try :smiley: )
- dhikrs with sound
- bluetooth powered finger dhikr, Yes :)

One good hearted person was lucky enough to support our app development and paid silicon valley level engineers to build this app for a year. We need to become self-sustaining to create the features we listed above. We needed to move an ad-supported model and also add a premium paid version. We don't have any costs than development (like we don't have offices or food cost) and outreach.
As we said "We started to make the best dhikr app to make people do more dhikrs.", we don't show full-screen ads or never put a banner in place that you can mistakenly touch. 

We will still offer a free version. Pro paid version will be for people who want to support us and want to use.

To be sustainable our first goal to reach 1000 Pro users. We hope you will be one of them.
