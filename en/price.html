<p>We started with the intention to make the best dhikr app possible and help make people do more dhikrs.</p>
<p>We released our first version nearly one year ago around February time.</p>
<p>In 1 year we reached 250M dhikrs (Mashallah), 2000 5 star reviews (Mashallah). Thanks to everyone. Mashallah to everyone.</p>
<p>Our next goal is to achieve 1 billion dhikrs.</p>
<p>In the next two years, we have many ideas, and we want to add many more features. (Inshallah)</p>
<p>These are <br />- new types of dhikrs (Like dhikr in every 100), or serial dhikrs like 33-33-33<br />- dhikr groups, <br />- sharing a group of dhikrs, <br />- no more manual type - search from Quran or pray libraries <br />- live dhikrs ( many people will do the same dhikr) <br />- social dhikr requests to help you to reach your dhikr goals<br />- list of dhikrs for needs<br />- smart notifications based on your time spent, location<br />- motive you to do more dhikrs<br />- dhikrs leaderboards<br />- dhikrs that will be flashed to your eyes so that you can see many dhikrs in a second.<br />- dhikrs with head movement (Yes, we will try :smiley: )<br />- dhikrs with sound<br />- bluetooth powered finger dhikr, Yes :)</p>
<p>One good hearted person was lucky enough to support our app development and paid silicon valley level engineers to build this app for a year. We need to become self-sustaining to create the features we listed above. We needed to move an ad-supported model and also add a premium paid version. We don't have any costs than development (like we don't have offices or food cost) and outreach.<br />As we said "We started to make the best dhikr app to make people do more dhikrs.", we don't show full-screen ads or never put a banner in place that you can mistakenly touch.</p>
<p>We will still offer a free version. Pro paid version will be for people who want to support us and want to use.</p>
<p>To be sustainable our first goal to reach 1000 Pro users. We hope you will be one of them.</p>
